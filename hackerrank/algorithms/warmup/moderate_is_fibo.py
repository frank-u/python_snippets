Problem Statement
    You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element
of the Fibonacci Sequence.
    The first few elements of fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13....
A fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous two
elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.

Formally:
    fib0 = 0
    fib1 = 1
    fibn = fibn-1 + fibn-2 âˆ€ n > 1

Input Format
    The first line contains T, number of test cases.
    T lines follows. Each line contains an integer N.

Output Format
    Display IsFibo if N is a fibonacci number and IsNotFibo if it is not a fibo-
nacci number. The output for each test case should be displayed on a new line.

Constraints
    1 <= T <= 10^5
    1 <= N <= 10^10

Sample Input

3
5
7
8

Sample Output

IsFibo
IsNotFibo
IsFibo

Explanation
5 is a Fibonacci number given by fib5 = 3 + 2
7 is not a Fibonacci number
8 is a Fibonacci number given by fib6 = 5 + 3

TimeLimit Time limit for this challenge is given here
